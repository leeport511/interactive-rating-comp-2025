## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I want to be better at React, so I tried to do with that library to start with something easy, beginner and start to increase the difficulty.
